## About Fantasy Legaue

Fantasy league is a friendly cricket fantasy league app where users can compete against one another in their groups. The idea is to scrape espncricinfo to get live scores data and assign scores to each player and then to every user's team.

### Flow

- Players join groups.
- Players make their teams for the day.
- Live scores is scrapped from [ESPN Cricinfo](http://espncricinfo.com/) and every users score is updated based on a simple algorithm that calculates points for a player depending on runs he scored, boundaries he hit, or wickets he take.
- As the live scores are fetched, rank every user in the group on the leaderboard based upon his net score.

DWoC is a winter long program organised by [Delta Force](https://delta.nitt.edu/), the coding club of NIT Trichy. With an aim to support and improve the culture of open source software around us, this serves as a platform for young student developers (or even starters) to hone their technical skills by working on projects of their interests. We hope this encourages collabrative experiences and allows students from all backgrounds to contribute to quality technical projects from diverse fields.
